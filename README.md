ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Luis, however, I go by kill_samurai on the net.

I'm a technical support engineer, I love helping people and I like learning about any technologies.

I'm currently studying python and finding that I enjoy coding in it better than others.

However I'm learning new technologies every single day.

Hope your stay is pleasent and that you've found what you came here looking for... if not... shoot me an email?
